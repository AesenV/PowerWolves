PowerWolves
===========
Internally called PowerDoges in some places for varying reasons.

It makes wolves better or something. Alpha quality. Stuff renders weird, may not work at all, and could crash at any time.

Yes, you can use it in modpacks. It's not a good idea but go ahead.

Compiling
=========
`./gradlew build`. Your file is at ./build/libs/PowerDoges-&lt;version&gt;.jar
